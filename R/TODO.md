# two things

I need to fix up the truck imputation in two ways.  First, I need to
fix so that it is more streamlined, more functional more sane to merge
in multiple or just one paired site.

Second I ned to fiddle with the simpuation stuff.  Waht I need to do
is to test the difference between using the summary report data and
not using the summary report data when produing the imputed values.

Frankly, I can't see how it might help, but it is worth testing.


# another thing

WIM self-imputation is broken.  Negative weights, speeds, way outliers
in the input data.
